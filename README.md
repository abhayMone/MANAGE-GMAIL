# MANAGE-GMAIL
According to Statista, nearly half of the emails sent worldwide are spam. 
In 2021, it was estimated that nearly 319.6 billion emails were sent and received daily.

Though Gmail marks most of the emails as spam, still we receive bunch of marketing and promotional emails. I have developed this datapipeline to see from what all domains, I receive emails daily. 
I have created dashboard where I can see all these stats and I can go and block the domains which makes my task lil easier instead of going through each and every email.
